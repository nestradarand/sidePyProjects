Wisconsin pines, collaborating with the day glow vibes
An altruistic breed of travel guide
It's chill, but lord knows you're trying
Zombie kids love to hear that easy
Going shit
Grab a guitar and
Just moaning shit
It's cool
But Lord knows you're trying
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying
You put your records on
Exclusively the old Pavement ones
A 90's soul with Doc Martens on
A step, a step away from crying
Degenerate, counter-culture, crying socialist
Hip-to-lazed crazed abstractionists
We're weird, but Lord knows we're trying
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying
Yeah
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
One step away from crying
Well that's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
Yeah-eh-eh thats the way it goes
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying
Yeah-eh-eh that's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
One step away from crying
See how the western kids
Have silicon inside their lips
A mask or an artifice
For the love that their parents give
The northern girls they play the part
With painted face, they're works of art
I swear to god I felt it then
The perfumed aura of wine and gin
I just love this I swear I'll go viral
From the burbs' to the streets now, it's a revival
The spirit is found in the idealistically idle
The age of excess
And I just love it
I just love it
I just love it
The midwestern plains recall
Firearms and alcohol
The proxy-server kind of men
The socialites they're brooding hens
The silhouettes they play the part
Their east coast digs are works of art
But the sickness sleeps inside our bones
With solipsistic overtones
I just love this I swear I'll go viral
From the burbs' to the streets now, it's a revival
The spirit is found in the idealistically idle
The age of excess
And I just love it yeah
I just love it yeah
I just love it yeah
I scream your name, as blood bursts from my veins.
In our darkest days, the blood bursts from my veins.
Crawling out of the sewer, crimson red.
Im calling out to the walking dead.
This is my home.
This is my only way.
x3 This is my home.
This is my only way HOME.
Oh the sun has died.
Face toward the halocline.
We all have died.
We are all the halocline.
SIng it now.
This is our home.
This is our only way.
Our stucco arms are forever tied loose
Your velvet touch sends me back to the moon
Daddy's coming home but mammas looking guilty
Brothers in the basement 'til he's thirty
Wolf child's heavy with the weight of the world
Storing all his love in an adolescent girl
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
Singing to the drunks like they're mom and dad
All we ever knew is what we didn't have
Never really knew if I did something wrong
All I ever heard was "it wasn't my fault"
But what good is truth if you don't understand
Nothing but a pair of calloused hands?
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
Singing to the drunks like our momma did
All we ever knew is what we didn't have
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
Singing to the drunks like our momma did
All we ever knew is what we didn't have
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I've been saying to ya
I heard it told by her mother old
She could try, she could try it
With the power of tin and a bottle of gin
She was wise, she was wise to it
Cocked her father's gun, like the oldest son
She could try, she could try it
Blessed by the bed where she laid her head and calmed to a dull roar
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
She felled the streets 'til she heard the screams
She could drive, she could drive it
That was where she'd buy her time, yeah
Her friends were crazed in the solemn rains
She could try, she could try it
I met her once, she was tight, she was tight
She was tight, she was tight, she was tight as hell
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me
Suicide Saturday
Suicide Saturday
Posted up, fours got stained from everything
Sippy cups, here's to us and no one else
You're like me, piece by piece you fall apart
Island home, ain't a terrible start
Half moon, hey to the daytime
Blueberry knees feeling just fine, yeah
Break up, down in the backyard
This simple season is all ours, yeah
Friendly storms seem to pull us back
Still lukewarm ashtray heart attacks
Daffodils, happy pills and harriet strikes
Half moon, hey to the daytime
Blueberry knees feeling just fine, yeah
Break up, down in the backyard
This simple season is all ours, yeah
Lake scene, knee deep in the stars
This simple season is all ours, yeah
Sweet love, kiss on the eyelid
Bruised up, chasing the sky, did
You say something about her
My legs brush up beside her
Too young looking for trouble
New god, lost in the struggle
One more night in the backyard
This simple season
This simple season is all ours
You came back, you wanted a piece of my heart or my love
you said you were clever but clever is never enough
a tremble, a shiver; the patience is something you lack
disastrous and matchless; the shivers that drip off your back
try to repair what you never quite see
the reasons you spoke of but never had given to me
all gone, are you ever really here
got you, Sophie so
you came back, you wanted to see through my two-colored eyes you left me at home with a down-trodden handful of sighs
all gone, are you ever really here? all gone, are you ever really here?
all gone. are you?
you came back. you wanted.
[Verse 1: Jake]
You see with golden eyes
The novocaine lullaby
Reach and crack the sky
With an open mouth, peace inside
American eyes
Cherry cheeks and bloodshot eyes
American eyes
See peace on earth and truth in lies
Violet, trying to start your riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
Violet, you and your fucked up riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
Then you'll come to me
With a bitter wind, in agony
Clean the reds, you'll see
The sky is lost in the company
Of those American eyes
See good on earth and truth in lies
Violet, trying to start your riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
Violet, you and your fucked up riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, you go, go, go (Violet)
You go, go, go, you go, go, go (Oh, Violet)
You go, go, go, you go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
Violet
Oh, Violet
I see meaning where you don't, where you don't
I see waves of pastel orange and yellow paintings fire
I see futures that you won't, that you won't
I see futures where our nights are lost to condensation
Night time in the basement, screaming about our feelings Running through the cold air
Searching for a meaning
Passed out on the concrete
Dizzy from the spinning
Wake up to the feeling that everybody's leaving
I'm sick of your come downs
Sick of your truce
Sick of your way
I'm sick of your tragedy that's living in our status
I'm sick of your echoes
Sick of these ghosts that haunt our place
I get a feeling that I'll never leave this house again
Night time in the basement, screaming about our feelings Running through the cold air
Searching for a meaning
Passed out on the concrete
Dizzy from the spinning
Wake up to the feeling that everybody's leaving
Everybody's leaving
Everybody's leaving
Failed by design, slow your pace down to mine
Watch my back, heave a sigh
Keep it safe, make it right
Failed by design, slow your pace down to mine
Watch my back, heave a sigh
Keep it safe, make it right
Night time in the basement, screaming about our feelings Running through the cold air
Searching for a meaning
Passed out on the concrete
Dizzy from the spinning
Wake up to the feeling that everybody's leaving
Everybody's leaving
Everybody's leaving
I swear to God, I wasn't born to fight
Maybe just a little bit, enough to make me sick of it
But I can read between the lines
I want to run from everything
But my legs won't work, it's clear to me
I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgivin'
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself
The timing's poor, I know it's never right
It's hard to see this time of night
Hard to know the reasons why I fucked it up again
Still I breathe a sigh
It doesn't seem so lucky now
Maybe I can figure out why
I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling
I think that I'm living, if you could call it living
So brash and unforgivin'
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now, to where I got to be
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now, to where I got to be
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now to where I got to be
Wait and see, I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now to where I got to be
Serving myself
Serving myself
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I suck, I suck
Yeah you do!
Tomorrow seems to seep into the edge of
nothing (a blueish tinted, faded vision, hey!)
Aimless eyes are searching for a better
something (but it's okay, it's indecision)
Pockets full of lilacs that I picked,
so pointless (the violet scented, clouded vision)
Creeping up,
the feelings that it's all for nothing (it's okay, it's indecision)
Honestly it's
Hard to know what you're thinking
Got to give up
It's no fun when you're leaving
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, but repetitive
Uncertainty, we chase ghosts, indifferent
Honestly, it's
Hard to know what you're thinking
Got to give up
It's no fun when you're leaving
Pair me with your roof and I might jump
Skull cracking open, throat with a lump
Summer will come by, then it will leave
Why am I wearing my heart on my sleeve?
Take away everything
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
Take away everything
Words like these don't come around enough for me
I am an ocean, quick to the draw
Legs of a runner, blood of my Pa
There's insides to outsides and I'm in both
Seems like I'm losing most of my hope
Take away everything
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
Take away everything
Words like these don't come around enough for me
What's the point of anything?
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
Take away everything
Words like these don't come around enough for me
What's the point of anything?
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
Take away everything
Words like these don't come around enough for me
